        <h1>Ethiopia: Where coffee and
            Mankind call home</h1>
            <img src="hut.png">
            <p>Ethiopia has produced some of the most extraordinary coffees in the world since its discovery eons ago. Ethiopia is widely recognized as the birthplace of coffee, and among coffee connoisseurs, the tale of a goat herder, a monk, and errant goats is almost as well-known as coffee itself. The biggest producer of coffee in Africa today, Ethiopia, is thought to have been exporting coffee as early as the 17th century, though the trade didn't take off until the 19th century.

                The value of coffee to the economy of the nation today cannot be overstated. Ethiopia is heavily dependent on coffee as a primary source of income: it accounts for close to 70% of all export revenues. An estimated 15 million Ethiopians are employed in the coffee industry. Ethiopia uses three different "production systems" for coffee: Forest Coffees, where locals harvest coffee that has grown wild; Garden Coffees, grown in small holder plots (typically measured in terms of trees rather than hectares); and Plantation Coffees, which make up a very small portion of Ethiopian coffee and are grown on vast estates. The Garden Coffee System is used to generate the great majority of the nation's coffee. Wet processing and sun-drying are the two most common methods for processing coffee. Currently, only 20–30% of Ethiopian coffee is washed, with the remaining 70–80% being sun- or no-washed. Ethiopians are among the continent's biggest coffee drinkers, and the coffee trend there is steadily
                 expanding. Domestic consumption accounts for about half of the nation's coffee production.</p>

                 <p>A 15-year coffee development strategy was recently introduced by the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority (ECTA), according to officials, and it will be crucial to optimizing the nation's coffee production capability.

                    The COVID-19 epidemic delayed the introduction of the plan, which was created in cooperation with the Ethiopian Institute of Agriculture Research (EIAR) and the international NGO TechnoServe, by more than two years. It points out prospects along the entire coffee value chain to significantly enhance the nation's exports of high-quality, environmentally friendly coffee, boosting farmer incomes and generating jobs for millions of people. The Coffee Strategy, which will be in effect until 2033, is built on six major pillars and intends to assist in the creation of a long-term, common vision among the sector's major players. These include processing, value-adding, marketing, value-added extension services, research, and sector strengthening.</p>
       
     
        <p><b>The minimum coffee pricing directive</b> was a new regulation that the Ethiopian Tea & Coffee Association issued to the market. The regulation obliges Ethiopian coffee exporters to sell their product at a minimum price or more. The weekly minimum pricing is broken down by location, grade, and exporter type.</p>

       <h2> How does it work?</h2><br>
<p>
            Simply put, we get you the coffee you need: type, price range, and shipment schedule.
            
            You share with us the details of your request, including:
           <br>
          > Origin<br>
            > Grade<br>
             > Target price<br>
             > Destination and<br>
             > Other requirements (certificates and the like)<br>
       
          We then disseminate your request with exporters who work with us and make 
            sure they comply with all your requirements. Instead of communicating with 
            numerous exporters individually, you contact them all at one place. However,
             that is not even the best part! We will also coordinate with the exporters 
             and facilitate the export process, including quality inspections, document verification,
              and so on, totally for free!</p><br><br>
